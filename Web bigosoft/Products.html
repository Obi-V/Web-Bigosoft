                Dark Souls takes place in the fictional kingdom of <b>Lordran</b>. Players take on
                the role of an undead human character who has been chosen to go on a pilgrimage to discover the fate of
                the undead. The plot of Dark Souls is told mainly through descriptions of objects in the game, and
                dialogues with non-playable characters (NPCs). Players must gather clues in order to understand the
                story. Dark Souls earned great recognition for its grueling difficulty and relentless challenge. The
                game world is full of weapons, armor, and consumable items that aim to help the player during their
                journey.
